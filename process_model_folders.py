#Here's what we're gonna do
#We're gonna use the cell_segmentation_training sourcefolder management to pre and postprocess our images/masks into 1stack and 3stack folders. Then, instead of segmenting in python,
#we'll use the command line methods that each each neural network makes available to go from the infolder to the outfolder.
